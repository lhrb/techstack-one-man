#### About the data

* the semantic unit (token) is a single word. 
  * no cleaning, like removing punctuation, merging synonyms (for example js and javascript are interpreted as different terms) ...
* valid tech-terms are stackoverflow tags with a usage count > 5000

Feel free to improve upon this.
